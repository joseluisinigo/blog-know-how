This error has happened to me several times over the years.
The problem:
When I enter linux, in my case kali linux windows appear either at the top left or at the bottom right. I can't move these windows.
When I open the menu it won't let me write inside the menu either.

The solution:
1st Clear the user cache

```
rm -Rv ~/.cache/sessions/
```
2ยบ Create a new user
